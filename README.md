# Charged

Charged is an Android app that notifies the user when the phone's battery level reaches 90% or above. It sounds an alarm to remind the user that the phone is almost fully charged and needs to be unplugged. This app is helpful for people who tend to leave their phones charging unattended.

## How to Install

1. Download the code from GitHub.
2. Download and install Android Studio.
3. Open the project in Android Studio.
4. Connect your phone to the computer (ensure that the phone is in developer mode).
5. Run the program on your phone.

## How to Use

1. Open the app on your phone.
2. Plug in your phone to charge.
3. Leave the app open while your phone is charging.
4. If the app makes a noise, it means your phone is fully charged.
